OVERVIEW

The mod_auth_ntlm_winbind module provides authentication and
authorisation over the web against a Microsoft Windows NT/2000/XP or
Samba Domain Controller using Samba's winbind daemon running on the
same machine Apache 1.x or 2.x is running on.

Used only by IE and newer versions of the Mozilla browser family, the
NTLM over HTTP protocol is completed undocumented by Microsoft but has
been reverse engineered and described at the following URL:

http://davenport.sf.net/ntlm.html


INSTALLATION

The configure.in script and Makefile are essentially wrappers around
apxs, which should be able to do all the work by itself. Having said
that, the build/install process should simply be a matter of:

$ autoconf
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

The configure script will attempt to locate apxs and httpd. It will
prefer apxs2 to apxs, and will use the httpd it finds to determine
whether it is building for Apache 1 or Apache 2. You can override the
detected settings using --with-apxs=/path/to/apxs and
--with-httpd=/path/to/httpd

In the event that the configure/Make combination doesn't work, you
should be able to do:

[Apache 1.x]
$ apxs -c -i mod_auth_ntlm_winbind.c

[Apache 2.x]
$ apxs -DAPACHE2 -c -i mod_auth_ntlm_winbind.c
(substitute apxs2 as appropriate)


CONFIGURATION

mod_auth_ntlm_winbind uses the same ntlm_auth helper as the Squid
proxy, so the same setup applies as for Squid: the winbindd_privileged
directory must be accessible by the webserver userid. The
configuration directives added by this module are as follows:

NTLMAuth
  set to 'on' to activate NTLM authentication
NegotiateAuth
  set to 'on' to activate Negotiate authentication
NTLMBasicAuthoritative
  set to 'off' to allow access control to be passed along to lower
  modules if the UserID is not known to this module
NTLMBasicAuth
  set to 'on' to activate Basic authentication (for non-NTLM browsers)
NTLMBasicRealm
  Realm to use for Basic authentication
NTLMAuthHelper
  Location and arguments to the Samba ntlm_auth utility for NTLM auth
NegotiateAuthHelper
  Location and arguments to the Samba ntlm_auth utility for Negotiate auth
PlaintextAuthHelper
  Location and arguments to the Samba ntlm_auth utility for Plaintext auth


The following httpd.conf configuration describes an example
configuration for this module:

NTLM authentication:

<Directory "/srv/www/auth">
  AuthName "NTLM Authentication thingy"
  NTLMAuth on
  NTLMAuthHelper "/usr/bin/ntlm_auth --helper-protocol=squid-2.5-ntlmssp"
  NTLMBasicAuthoritative on
  AuthType NTLM
  require valid-user
</Directory>

or, to enable 'NTLM+Negotiate' authentication too:

<Directory "/srv/www/auth">
  AuthName "NTLM Authentication thingy"
  NTLMAuth on
  NegotiateAuth on
  NTLMAuthHelper "/usr/bin/ntlm_auth --helper-protocol=squid-2.5-ntlmssp"
  NegotiateAuthHelper "/usr/bin/ntlm_auth --helper-protocol=gss-spnego"
  NTLMBasicAuthoritative on
  AuthType NTLM
  AuthType Negotiate
  require valid-user
</Directory>


To debug what is going on, add the following line to your httpd.conf
to enable debug messages to be written to the apache error log file:
